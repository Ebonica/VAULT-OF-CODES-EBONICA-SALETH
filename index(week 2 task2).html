        <h3>CREATING A PORTFOLIO PAGE(TASK1: COMPONENT CREATION)</h3>
        <p>
            I created this code to develop a simple card component, allowing me to showcase a specific project on my portfolio page. I used CSS to style the card with a clean and visually appealing design, making sure it was responsive to various screen sizes. The content, including the project title, description, and image, was customized for my specific project. I included a "View Project" button, which I linked to my actual project or further project details. This code served as a foundation for my portfolio page, enabling me to add more cards to display multiple projects. I successfully integrated this card into my portfolio page, customizing it for each project I wanted to present.
