        <h1>Project Details</h1>
        
        <h2>HTML DETAILS (index.html)</h2>
        <p>I declared the HTML version being used with &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;.</p>
        <p>In the opening HTML tag, I specified the language of the page as English with the "en" attribute.</p>
        <p>I defined the head section of the HTML document, including metadata and links to external resources.</p>
        <p>I set the character encoding to UTF-8 with &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; to ensure proper text rendering.</p>
        <p>To make the page responsive, I configured the viewport with &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;.</p>
        <p>I linked an external CSS file (styles.css) to style the page.</p>
        <p>The page title was set to "Portfolio" using &lt;title&gt;Project Details&lt;/title&gt;.</p> <!-- Fixed title --></p>
        
        <h2>CSS DETAILS (styles.css)</h2>
        <p>I defined styling rules for various elements within the card component:</p>
        <p>I styled the background color, alignment, and spacing for the body element.</p>
        <p>The .portfolio-card container was styled, including its background color, box shadow, border radius, padding, and text alignment.</p>
        <p>For the project image inside the card (.portfolio-card img), I set its width and border radius.</p>
        <p>The font size and margin for the project title (.portfolio-card h3) were adjusted by me.</p>
        <p>I defined the font size for the project description (.portfolio-card p).</p>
        <p>The "View Project" button (.btn) was styled by me, including its background color, text color, padding, border, and border radius.</p>
        <p>I also handled the button's appearance on hover with the .btn:hover selector.</p>
        
        <h2>CARD COMPONENT STRUCTURE</h2>
        <p>I created the main container for the card component with .portfolio-card.</p>
        <p>I added an image element that displayed the image specific to my project with &lt;img src="My Image file" alt="Project"&gt;.</p>
        <p>The project title was set using &lt;h3&gt;CREATING A PORTFOLIO PAGE(TASK1: COMPONENT CREATION)&lt;/h3&gt;.</p>
        <p>I provided a project description in a paragraph element &lt;p&gt;Description of your project goes here. You can provide details about the project, technologies used, and its impact.&lt;/p&gt;.</p>
        <p>To allow users to view the project, I added a link styled as a button with &lt;a href="#" class="btn"&gt;View Project&lt;/a&gt;.</p>
        <p>The href attribute could be linked to my project or more information about it.</p>
        
        <a href="index(week 2 task2)" class="btn">Back to Portfolio</a>
